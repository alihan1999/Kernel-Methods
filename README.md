# Kernel Ridge Playground
A notebook to experiment ridge regression with various kernels and lambdas

It also includes the implementation of kernel ridge from scratch

Here's a sample output:

## What are we doing?!

We are optimzing $\min\limits_{f\in\mathcal{H}}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-f(x_i))^2 + \lambda||f||_{\mathcal{H}}^2$
